One of the most fascinating aspects of mathematics is the variety in perspectives of studying a mathematical topic. As we explore more and more branches of mathematics, it is interesting to see how some seemingly unrelated branches actually interconnect with each other when we start rethinking certain mathematical topics we've learnt before.

One topic worth discussing is complex numbers. When I was studying in high school, complex numbers was introduced to me as an extension of real numbers, with the addition of the imaginary part, $i$, that allows $i^2=-1$, which does not make sense in the world of real numbers, to hold, resulting in numbers of the form $a+bi$, where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part ... and so on.

Sure, this way of explanation is not wrong. However, sometimes it helps us to better understand complex numbers and how it relates to other subjects of mathematics when we look into complex numbers from a different angle.

## Linear Algebra

Complex numbers can be viewed as a two-dimensional vector space, with bases $1$ and $i$.

The complex conjugate is the dual space to the space of complex numbers.

## Abstract Algebra

Complex numbers can be seen as a group, both additive (for Cartesian form) and multiplicative (for Euler's form).

Regarding multiplicative groups, a topic of interest that arises would be the roots of unity, which is a cyclic multiplicative group with the order of $n$.

## Complex Analysis

Complex numbers can be viewed as position vectors on a 2D Cartesian plane or polar plane.
