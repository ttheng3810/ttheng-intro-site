# hi. üëã

I'm **TAN Tze Heng** - Èô≥Êô∫ÊÅÜ - from Sabah, Malaysia, and I'm currently a second year undergraduate of the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), pursuing a Major in Mathematics.

Inspired by notable communicators in mathematics such as [Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) and [Brady Haran](https://www.numberphile.com/) since my secondary school times, I took the major decision in my life to pursue even further mathematics in university. Right away, I was amazed by the academic rigour, depth and diversity displayed by the [flourishing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-math-breakthroughs-in-2022-20221222/) mathematics scene.

I appreciate how the university curriculum provides me the exposure that I need to hone my skills in problem solving, computational thinking and mathematical reasoning - crucial skills that help me in further exploring pure mathematics.

Some of my areas of interest in mathematics include number theory and mathematical logic.

I hope to contribute and share my takeaways from this learning journey to the academia as well as broader communities, thereby inspiring more to appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

Mathematics aside, some other stuff that I dabble in include [some coding](https://github.com/ttheng3810) and [music](https://musescore.com/tantzeheng/).
